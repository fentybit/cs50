        Hello, World! My name is Fenty, a Full Stack developer with experience in JavaScript, React,
        Redux, HTML/CSS, Swift and Ruby on Rails. I have a background in architecture with a focus
        on healthcare and sustainability discipline. I have had a fascination for building things
        since I was young, from arts and crafts to assembling built-construction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, I found my new passion in programming, and it aligns with my true interest in
        analytical thinking and problem solving. I began my journey from Codecademy and freeCodeCamp
        platform to enrolling myself in the Flatiron School Software Engineering program. I believe
        the core principles of architecture and my background in mathematics will be a good catalyst
        to my growth in the field of programming. I am excited to contribute my skills and past
        experiences to this journey!
