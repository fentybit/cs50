sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: It runs a bit more efficient compared to sort3 when running sorted numbers. Bubble Sort has linear time complexity on best scenario.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It runs most efficient on random, reversed and sorted numbers on time complexity.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It runs least efficient as the time complexity is still O(n^2) on all given numbers.
